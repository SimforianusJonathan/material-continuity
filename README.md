# Material Continuity

Material Continuity is a versioned, evidence-bound workflow for recovering from
critical manufacturing material disruptions. The agent coordinates the
investigation, deterministic services perform calculations and enforce
constraints, and humans retain release authority.

The current implementation is the first local deterministic slice: a synthetic
bearing scenario and an exposure engine that calculates the first shortage date
and affected production orders.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- No third-party packages are required for the current slice

## Run the canonical exposure scenario

```powershell
python -m core.exposure --material MAT-BRG-001 --as-of 2026-09-29T00:00:00+00:00
```

## Run tests

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
